# ZMAP SSH Probe

An efficient and user-friendly tool to scan and check SSH login credentials.

## Description

SSH Scanner is designed to help sysadmins and security professionals verify SSH login credentials across a range of IPs. It utilizes a multi-threaded approach for speedy checks, ensuring you get results in real-time.

Inspired by [Zmap-ProxyScanner](https://github.com/Yariya/Zmap-ProxyScanner).

## Features

- Multi-threaded scanning.
- Support for large IP ranges.
- Efficient error handling and reporting.
- Detailed logging of successful and failed login attempts.
- Integration with Zmap for IP scanning.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Rust installed on your machine.
- Zmap installed (for IP scanning integration).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SourM1lk/zmap_ssh_probe.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd zmap_ssh_probe
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

****Note**: Ensure that the `credentials.txt` file is in the same directory as the executable before running the scanner.
**

## Usage

To use SSH Scanner with Zmap:

```bash
# Warning: This zmap command scans the internet. Ensure your ZMAP command targets only authorized IPs.
zmap -p 22 | ./target/release/zmap_ssh_probe [OPTIONS]
```

Options:
- `-p, --port <PORT>`: Specify the SSH port to target. Default is `22`.
- `-o, --output_file <FILENAME>`: Name of the file to which successful logins will be written. Default is `results.txt`.
- `-w, --workers <WORKER_COUNT>`: Number of workers to use for scanning. Default is `1000`.

Example:
****Note**: The scanner currently spawns 10 threads. FI you want to change this find `#[tokio::main(flavor = "multi_thread", worker_threads = 10)]` and change to the ammount of threads you want. This also splits your workers. Example 1000 workers across 10 threads equals 100 workers per thread.
**
```bash
# Warning: This zmap command scans the internet. Ensure your ZMAP command targets only authorized IPs.
zmap -p 22 | ./target/release/zmap_ssh_probe -p 22 -o TestResults.txt -w 500
